		<p>North Campus is a community centered around education. Located in north St. Louis City, 
			North Campus includes the Oâ€™Fallon neighborhood and sections of the Penrose and College Hill 
			neighborhoods (See our map here: <a href="www.google.com">www.northcampus.org/map</a>). Our goal is to build a pipeline of success 
			from birth through college graduation for all the children living in our boundaries.

			Our Mission is to coordinate an expansive network of partnerships working together for a common goal: 
			providing the children of the North Campus with a world-class education and an enriching childhood 
			experience so that they will ultimately lift themselves and their families out of poverty.
